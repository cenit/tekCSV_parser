# tekCSV_parser

## Prerequisites

You need matplotlib and numpy Python libraries to run `tekCSV_parser`.

For example, on Ubuntu, this is the command line to install these libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python python-matplotlib python-numpy
```

While the script is written in Python 3, it should be compatible with Python 2 (but it is unsupported and may become broken anytime).

## Equipment

To produce CSV files compatible with this parser, you need a digital oscilloscope (MSO2000B and DPO2000B Series are tested)
